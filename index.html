        She lived in a cozy teacup house and dreamed of skies made of candy clouds. 
        One morning, she noticed the wind had stopped dancing. She packed her crayons and set off to find the missing breeze. </p2>

            She saw strange patterns in the stars — something was off. With her ancient scrolls and quiet strength, 
            she prepared a spell to protect Hironovia from whatever was coming. </p2>
